<p>Hey, welcome to little tiny space of the internet where i like to share some texts about CTF, Hacking and CyberSec related stuff. I will try to maintain this as a personal deposit/journal, but knowledge should be for everyone, so i decided to build this website for who wanted to read and learn too! </p>

<p>Now a little bit about myself: Since i was a child i always used the computer, mostly for gaming, but the time to choose a carrer became, i connected the dots and decided to get a Computer Science degree. Inicially the ideia was learn how to programming to create and work with games, but as the time goes i was influenced by the local InfoSec events that my university hosts sometimes, the community around them and by the game Watch_Dogs (1 and 2) and Mr. Robot TV Show (why not? haha). So i got this "Hacking thing" as a hobbie during my time in college. When i graduated i got a job as Android Developer and lost the love in making games, maybe a little in consuming them too, but they has oppened this door for me, and then i was building commercial apps for local companies. Doesn't take much time for me to drop all this Dev world and dive into Security, the hobbie that i was into so much time. I took a job as Support in a NOC and with some friends that i met in the security community we created together a CTF team, <a href="https://deadlock.team">Deadlock</a>! In my job i was promoted from Support to Level 2 Analyst, working with Fortinet firewalls and after that i finally get where i am now. Today i work in a company that sells Security as a Service and there the job is kind being part of a Blue Team, the mission is defend the network of a lot of companies around the country and one day, around the globe, using and creating a lot of cool stuff and technologies!</p>

<p>So thats it, welcome and i hope that you can learn a lot of stuff here! Anything, you know where to find me (:</p>
